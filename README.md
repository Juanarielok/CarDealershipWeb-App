## ‧₊˚✩彡 Description

I utilized TailwindCSS to design an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly interface. TailwindCSS enabled me to create a clean and modern look for the application with its utility-first approach, ensuring both visual appeal and ease of use. To guarantee dependable and precise results, Jest was employed for unit testing all functions within the service. For thorough and transparent documentation, JSDoc was utilized to deliver detailed descriptions of classes, functions, and other system components. Moreover I integrated accessibility features into the application in accordance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). This ensures that the app is usable by individuals with diverse disabilities, providing a more inclusive experience for all users. By adhering to these guidelines, I improved the app’s accessibility, making it more navigable and functional for everyone, regardless of their ability, so that everyone can easily choose their preferred vehicle model and year and interact with the site
